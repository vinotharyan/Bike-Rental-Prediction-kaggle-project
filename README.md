# Bike-Rental-Prediction-kaggle-project
Among the various means of transport there are none that are cleaner and economical than the bike (also known as bicycle). We are witnessing the rise of automated bike sharing systems that handle bike rentals and returns with great efficacy. We have with us two years' data (2011 and 2012) from the Capital Bike share system in Washington D.C., USA, which is one such system. Using this data we attempt to build a statistical model that can predict the number of bikes rented at a given hour on a given day using information such as weather, day of the week, whether the day is a holiday etc.
